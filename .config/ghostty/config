# ~/.config/ghostty/config
# Config file for Ghostty terminal emulator.
#
# Run `ghostty +show-config --default --docs` to view a list of
# all available config options and their default values.
#
# Additionally, each config option is also explained in detail
# on Ghostty's website, at https://ghostty.org/docs/config.

# Config syntax crash course
# ==========================
# The config file consists of simple key-value pairs,
# separated by equals signs.
# Keys can be set without a value to set it to the default value.
# e.g. font-family =

window-height = 30
window-width = 80
font-family = "SF Mono"
font-size = 11
theme = "One Half Dark"
alpha-blending = linear-corrected
window-colorspace = display-p3
